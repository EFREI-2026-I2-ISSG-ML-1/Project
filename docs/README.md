# ST2MLE : Machine Learning for IT Engineers

## Project  
**Machine Learning Project – Numerical and Textual Data (French Context)**

---

### Context

As part of this project, students will work on mixed data (numerical and textual) collected from French websites.  
The objective is to carry out a comprehensive analysis, from data collection to modeling and interpretation, with a focus on a French economic, social, or public context.

---

### Learning Objectives

- Master the full lifecycle of a data project (collection, cleaning, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation).
- Apply techniques for text processing and numerical data analysis.
- Explore various text vectorization techniques (BoW, TF-IDF, Doc2Vec, BERT).
- Conduct analyses and provide recommendations based on real French data.

---

### Project Steps

1. Define a topic, the needs and identify relevant French sources.  
2. Choose a dataset (e.g., Kaggle…).  
3. Clean and preprocess both numerical and textual data.  
4. Label the variables, if needed.  
5. Perform exploratory analysis and visualizations (distributions, word clouds, correlations...) to check for outliers, class imbalance, etc.  
6. Apply under-sampling or oversampling (if needed), PCA for feature extraction (if needed).  
7. Apply predictive models:  
   - Numerical data: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Boosting.  
   - Textual data: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression after vectorization.  
8. Compare text vectorization methods: BoW, TF-IDF, Doc2Vec, BERT.  
9. Provide business recommendations and submit a final report.

# ST2MLE: Machine Learning for IT Engineers Project

## Machine Learning Project - Numerical and Textual Data (French Context)

### Context

[cite_start]As part of this project, students will work on mixed data (numerical and textual) collected from French websites. [cite: 1] [cite_start]The objective is to carry out a comprehensive analysis, from data collection to modeling and interpretation, with a focus on a French economic, social, or public context. [cite: 2]

### Learning Objectives

* [cite_start]Master the full lifecycle of a data project (collection, cleaning, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation). [cite: 3]
* [cite_start]Apply techniques for text processing and numerical data analysis. [cite: 4]
* Explore various text vectorization techniques (BoW, TF-IDF, Doc2Vec, BERT).
* [cite_start]Conduct analyses and provide recommendations based on real French data. [cite: 5]

### Project Steps

1.  [cite_start]Define a topic, the needs and identify relevant French sources. [cite: 6]
2.  [cite_start]Choose a dataset (ex. Kaggle ...) [cite: 7]
3.  Clean and preprocess both numerical and textual data.
4.  [cite_start]Label the variables, if needed. [cite: 8]
5.  Perform exploratory analysis and visualizations (distributions, word clouds, correlations...) to check for outliers, class imbalance, etc.
6.  [cite_start]Apply under-sampling or oversampling (if needed), PCA for feature extraction (if needed). [cite: 9]
7.  Apply predictive models:
    * Numerical data: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Boosting.
    * [cite_start]Textual data: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression after vectorization. [cite: 9]
8.  [cite_start]Compare text vectorization methods: BoW, TF-IDF, Doc2Vec, BERT. [cite: 10]
9.  Provide business recommendations and submit a final report.

### Deliverables

[cite_start]Each group should submit: [cite: 11]

1.  [cite_start]Project report (.pdf) including: [cite: 11]
    * [cite_start]Description of the problem, the needs and the collected data [cite: 12]
    * [cite_start]Detailed cleaning and preprocessing workflow. [cite: 12]
    * [cite_start]Clear visualizations. [cite: 12]
    * [cite_start]Modeling and comparisons. [cite: 12]
    * [cite_start]Result analyses and business recommendations. [cite: 12]
2.  [cite_start]Well-documented Python code. [cite: 12]

**Deadline for report submission and presentation: Thursday June 19 at 8 AM. [cite_start]One submission per group.** [cite: 13]
[cite_start]Please mention all student names in the report and notebook. [cite: 14]

[cite_start]Oral presentation: Monday 19 June. [cite: 14]
[cite_start]Number of students per group: minimum 4, maximum 5. [cite: 15]
